# Elegoo-SmartCar
Continuing to develop my program for the Elegoo SmartCar v4 using the Elegoo Smartcar Shield v1.1 and an Arduino Uno R3. 

This is NOT yet the final product, but now has its own repository due to my plans to create a more modular approach to programming the car using multiple .cpp and .h files. I think this will make it easier for me to develop the code, and upload updates as development continues.

This does not yet have the full functionality of the latest version in my Elegoo-SmartCar-Dev repository while I continue to learn how to properly use header files in C++
